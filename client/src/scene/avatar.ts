/**
 * A person at the table.
 *

 * not from fidelity, and a stylised body reads its own trembling far more
 * clearly than a detailed one would. What matters here is that the anatomy is
 * *complete* — head, torso, arms, hands, and five separate fingers per hand —
 * because every later phase hangs something off one of those parts.
 *
 * The local player's own head is hidden. You are inside it.
